# 5.1-remote-kit
Schematics &amp; Datasheets

I've successfully completed a 5.1 remote kit with the following facilities. 
It uses Microcontroller STC12C5A60S2 and R2S15902FP/ PT2351 chips. 
The main facility in this Remote kit is any settings including input gainer, output gainer and splash screen  can be changed even after programming the Micro controller chip.

Here is some photos of it.

A brief description of facilities available is below:

• 6 channels independent electronic volume (0 to –99dB/1dBstep, –8dB)

• 6 channels independent gain control (0 to +14dB/ 2dB step)

• L/R channel 4 input selector (Input gain: 0 to +14dB/ 2dB step)

• Multi channel input: 6 channels input

• Tone control Bass: –14 to + 14dB(2dB step),

               Treble: –14 to + 14dB(2dB step)

• Manual Adjustments ( Vol, Input, Gain, Tone ) can be done via Encoder & Keypad

The circuit and other details can be downloaded from the above attachment.
